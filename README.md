Welcome to [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org) conversations repo. You belong in The Carpentries.

We envision this repository as a first step in developing a thoughtful, efficient, and community-driven communications strategy.
We propose that this repository become the canonical channel for communicating new ideas, suggestions, and progress updates between Carpentries community members and [team](https://carpentries.org/team/).  

To take part in the conversation about developing communication strategy - please respond to the issue ["Developing a Transparent and Community-Driven Communications Strategy"](https://github.com/carpentries/conversations/issues/1).  

To start another conversation about a suggestion you have, ask a question about ongoing work, or give feedback about an issue or obstacle you face in the community, please [start a new issue][issues].

As we work to develop a communications strategy, The Carpentries [team](https://carpentries.org/team/) will actively monitor this repo and follow-up on issues. All decisions about communications will "live" on this repo. If the community-driven process leads to a decision to use a mechanism other than GitHub for facilitating communications, this repo will be retired and communications migrated to a permanent canonical channel.
