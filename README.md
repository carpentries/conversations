Welcome to [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org) conversations repo. You belong in The Carpentries.

This repository is the channel for communicating new ideas, suggestions, and progress updates between Carpentries community members and [the Core Team](https://carpentries.org/team/) and includes comments and discussions relevant to our community [blog posts]https://carpentries.org/blog/.    

To start another conversation about a suggestion you have, ask a question about ongoing work, or give feedback about an issue or obstacle you face in the community, please [start a new issue][issues]. The Carpentries [Community Development Team](https://carpentries.org/core-team-projects/) will actively monitor this repo and follow-up on issues as they are posted. A detailed plan on how this will be managed is forthcoming, but all decisions will "live" on this repo to promote transparency within the community.
