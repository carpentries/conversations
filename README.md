Welcome to [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org) conversations repository. You belong in The Carpentries!

-----------

This repository is the channel for communicating new ideas, suggestions, and progress updates between The Carpentries community members and [the Core Team](https://carpentries.org/team/). It also includes comments and discussions relevant to our community [blog posts](https://carpentries.org/blog/).

## Comments associated with our websites

The Carpentries websites use [utteranc.es](https://utteranc.es/) as a commenting
system. Each page or blog post where commenting is enabled corresponds to an
[issue](https://github.com/carpentries/carpentries.org-comments/issues) in this
repository. Comments for our lesson program websites (https://datacarpentry.org,
https://software-carpentry.org, and https://librarycarpentry.org) all go to this
repository and are identified with different labels.

To be able to post comments on the site, you will need to authorize the utteranc.es
application the first time you use it.

## General conversations

To start a new conversation about a suggestion you have, ask a question about ongoing work, or give feedback about an issue or obstacle you face in the community, please [open a new issue][issues]. The Carpentries [Community Development Team](https://carpentries.org/core-team-projects/#community-development-team) will actively monitor this repository and follow-up on issues as they are posted. A detailed plan on how this will be managed is forthcoming, but all decisions will "live" on this repository to promote transparency within the community.
