Welcome to the Carpentry conversations repo.  

We envision this repository as a first step in developing a thoughtful, efficient, and community-driven communications strategy.
We propose that this repository become the canonical channel for communicating new ideas, suggestions, and progress updates between Carpentry community members and staff.  

To take part in the conversation about developing communication strategy - please respond to the issue ["Developing a Transparent and Community-Driven Communications Strategy"](https://github.com/carpentries/conversations/issues/1).  

To start another conversation about a suggestion you have, ask a question about ongoing work, or give feedback about an issue or obstacle you face in the community, please [start a new issue][issues].

As we work to develop a communications strategy, Carpentry staff will actively monitor this repo and follow-up on issues. All decisions about communications will "live" on this repo. If the community-driven process leads to a decision to use a mechanism other than GitHub for facilitating communications, this repo will be retired and communications migrated to a permanent canonical channel.
