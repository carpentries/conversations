Welcome to [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org) conversations repository. You belong in The Carpentries!

This repository is the channel for communicating new ideas, suggestions, and progress updates between The Carpentries community members and [the Core Team](https://carpentries.org/team/). It also includes comments and discussions relevant to our community [blog posts](https://carpentries.org/blog/).

To start another conversation about a suggestion you have, ask a question about ongoing work, or give feedback about an issue or obstacle you face in the community, please [start a new issue][issues]. The Carpentries [Community Development Team](https://carpentries.org/core-team-projects/#community-development-team) will actively monitor this repository and follow-up on issues as they are posted. A detailed plan on how this will be managed is forthcoming, but all decisions will "live" on this repository to promote transparency within the community.
